Steps-
1. Import Statements: The `import` statement is used to include necessary classes from the `java.util` package, which contains the `Scanner` class for reading user input.

2. `main` Method: This is the entry point of the program. It initializes a `Scanner` object to read input from the user.

3. Greeting and User Interaction:
   - The program starts by printing a greeting message: "Hello! I'm a simple chatbot. How can I help you today?"
   - It then enters a loop where it repeatedly prompts the user for input and responds with a message from the chatbot.

4. `getBotResponse` Method: This method takes the user's input as a parameter and returns a response from the chatbot based on the input.
   - The user input is converted to lowercase to make it case-insensitive.
   - The method checks the user input for specific keywords or phrases using `if` and `else if` statements to determine the appropriate response.
   - Responses are generated based on the keywords. For example, if the user input contains "hello" or "hi," the chatbot responds with a friendly greeting. If the user mentions "weather," the chatbot responds with a weather-related message.

5. Ending the Conversation:
   - The loop continues until the user types "bye" (case-insensitive). When the user types "bye," the loop exits, and the chatbot says "Goodbye! Have a great day."

6. Running the Program:
   - The program is compiled and executed in a Java development environment or command-line interface.
   - Users can type messages, and the chatbot responds based on the keywords and phrases it recognizes.

Overall, this code provides a basic demonstration of a console-based chatbot that engages in a simple conversation with the user. You can expand and customize this code to include more responses, integrate natural language processing, or create a graphical user interface for a more interactive chatbot experience.
